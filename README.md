# flutter_stats

A basic app that shows some stats. These stats would usually come from aggregating certain uses of the app, but some mock data is generated as the stats.

## Getting Started

Create and link up your own Firebase project, then run the app on your chosen device. If there is no data, you will be able to generate some mock data.
